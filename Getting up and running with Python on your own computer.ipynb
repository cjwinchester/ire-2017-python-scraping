    "\n",
    "Regardless of your OS, you'll want to install a decent text editor. I use [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/). [Atom](https://atom.io/) is good, too. If you're on a Mac, TextWrangler is another option; if you're on a PC, you could check out [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).\n",

    "## 3. Verify that `pip` is installed\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip` is a package manager for Python; you'd use it to install third-party libraries like `requests` or `BeautifulSoup4` into a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you installed Python3 or later versions of Python 2, you should already have `pip` available as a command in your terminal. In your terminal, type `pip -V` to verify that it's available.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get an error that says the `pip` command is not available, [download this file](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py), then, in your terminal, `cd` into the directory where the file lives and run `python get-pip.py`. [The project's documentation site](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) has more details if you get stuck.\n",

    "### Install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools will allow you to create a \"virtual environment\" for each project. Virtual environments are sort of like sandboxes that keep your projects' dependencies sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Kenneth Reitz, again, has a good tutorial on installing these tools](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/#virtualenvironments-ref).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Start a new project\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper`, you can create a project. Let's say you want to run a Jupyter notebook to scrape a simple page: you'll need `jupyter`, `requests` and `BeautifulSoup4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "From your terminal, make a new directory called `my-project` and then `cd` into it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir my-project\n",
    "cd my-project\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now make a new virtual environment using the `mkvirtualenv` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkvirtualenv my-project\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command also _activates_ the virtual environment that you just created -- you should see `(my-project)` prepended to your terminal prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can install the Python packages that you need using `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install jupyter requests BeautifulSoup4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "... and once that installs, you can launch a Jupyter notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To deactivate your virtual environment, you can type `deactivate`. You'll notice that the prepended text disappears.\n",
    "\n",
    "To work on an existing virtual environment, use the `workon` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkvirtualenv my-project\n",
    "# (my-project) $\n",
    "\n",
    "deactivate\n",
    "# $\n",
    "\n",
    "workon my-project\n",
    "# (my-project) $\n",
